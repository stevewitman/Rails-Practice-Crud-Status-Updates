# README

## This is a basic rails app with PostgreSQL, RSpec and Capybara.
#### Turbolinks, Spring, and Test Unit have been removed.

## Your mission:

* Crud "status updates" like in Facebook.  Fields are status (text), user (string) and number of likes (integer).  All three should be present.
* There should be at least one capybara spec to cover it.
* Create and update redirect to show.  There should be flash messages.
* Everyone should spend no more than a few minutes before asking, or looking it up, and should write down what they needed help with in detail (so everyone should have a list of things they missed) and will submit a write up.
* All class time of 3:30 is the time to beat (as a class)
* Once you accept someone, they can opt to become acceptors and can put their names in a board.  Submit and do the write up when you are done.
